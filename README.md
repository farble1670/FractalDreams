Fractal Dreams
===
Simple Android dream services that draws zooming, rotating Mandelbrot and Julia sets. You'd never want to actually use this as a dream service as it'd make your phone very hot.

I just wanted to see how far I could take performance. The results are marginal. There are lots of knobs and dials to adjust performance (with tradeoffs) in the code.
